    "fullDescription": "Engineered a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) generative AI pipeline that empowers users to co-create personalized auditory cues. The system integrates Mistral 7B for intent reasoning and AudioLDM2 for synthesis, allowing users to iteratively refine outputs through natural language feedback and fine-grained controls. This interactive workflow ensures the generated cues are not only high-fidelity but semantically aligned with the user’s specific cognitive associations.",

    "fullDescription": "This project investigates the impact of cognitive-level personalization in spatial audio on object localization in Virtual Reality. Using the Meta XR SDK and Unity, we developed an environment to test how specific cues improve sound source localization. The study evaluates cue effectiveness by measuring search time and validating results through integrated in-VR questionnaires, including the NASA-TLX for workload and UEQ-S for user experience.",
