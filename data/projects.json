    "fullDescription": "Engineered a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) generative AI pipeline that empowers users to co-create personalized auditory cues. The system integrates Mistral 7B for intent reasoning and AudioLDM2 for synthesis, allowing users to iteratively refine outputs through natural language feedback and fine-grained controls. This interactive workflow ensures the generated cues are not only high-fidelity but semantically aligned with the user’s specific cognitive associations.",

    "fullDescription": "This project explores the impact of cognitive-level personalization in spatial audio on object localization in Virtual Reality. By leveraging the Meta XR SDK and Unity, we created an environment to test user performance in locating a sound source. The study evaluates the effectiveness of these cues by measuring localization speed (search time), while utilizing integrated in-VR questionnaires—specifically NASA-TLX for workload assessment and UEQ-S for user experience quality—to validate the results.",
